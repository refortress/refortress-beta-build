<pre>Background:  This is a remake of the classic 2fort.  The purpose of this remake is to achieve a better state of play via fixing a few problems, namely:
A: Remove the ability for engineers to build in respawns and resupplies, thereby ensuring defenders killed leave a hole in the defence for longer than 3 seconds
B: Marginally widen some spam-prone locations such as the spiral and lift bottom
C: Remove a few grenades from each bag, thereby ensuring less spam is available
D: Fix many of 2fort's niggles, such as the lift resupply turret maiming offence members when a defender opens the door (skill no, lame yes, effective -- sadly yes)

The name is just a nice imitation of QWTF's 2fortX (x being release version) coupled with the fact it's 2004.. 2k4 .. 2fort4 .. 2kfort4.  Woei.

New Environment		: Yes -- Fullmoon.  Thanks to [WTF?]MoOg.  Few custom skies have me struggling to pick something else.. ;)
Editor used		: Valve Hammer Editor 3.4
Build time		: Roughly a day and a half for the main construction.. most of the time expended afterwards was getting feedback and tweaking things.
Compile time		: Roughly 17 minutes with -full vis and -extra rad on Barton 2500 @ 3200 & 512 megs PC3200 RAM.

<h2>--------------------Play Information-----------------------</h2>2kfort4 - Standard CTF.
Grab the enemy flag from their basement and capture it on the battlements of your base for 10 frags and 10 team points.
<h2>--------------------Changes Since First Release------------</h2>Not too much, just general tweaks and things.  The main things:
* Remade flags and cap points using entities to try and eliminate the "you captured the flag" message being delivered to all players for whatever reason (weird bug!)
* Optimised some parts using the null texture on hidden faces
* Added respawn turret to lift resupply in the corner so it cannot shoot offence members outside, but will protect defenders in the resupply
* Moved grenade bag @ tsp up a few virtual feet so offence members do not take it by accident any longer
* Added a secondary grenade to the far respawn's grenade bag so offence members can prime whilst picking up the bag and receive full concs
* Optimised func_illusionaries in various parts of the maps by grouping them together where possible (engy sg building not affected)
* Moved lift trigger so it behaves in the exact same manner as that of the original 2fort elevator
* Lowered lift doorway in line with the original (no more snagging whilst concing / RJing to bottom lift area)
* Lightened things a little more from b1
* Removed protection to stop flag being thrown on top of the battlements because it impeded throwing grenades / pipes etc over the hut (be careful!)
* Added BluR's face (excellent, if I may so bold as to comment myself)
* Straightened grenade bags in far respawn (they were slightly squint... yes I'm sure you're reading this and care!)
* Added the fullmoon sky
* Slightly blue-ish lighting added
* Some other minor things I can't remember now :<
