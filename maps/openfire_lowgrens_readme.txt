<<----------------------------->> Changes in Open Fire League <<------------------------------>>

- removed env_sound entities to fix bug that would apply sound reflection effects to all sounds in Half-Life after dying inside the openfire tunnel.

- added Security up/down text and spoken messages. (wav files borrowed from Shutdown)

- fixed bug where the red team's armour would take longer to respawn than the blue team's armour.

- added .res file indexing all resources required by the map (openfire.wad, sounds, texts etc) so they can be downloaded off any server.

- moved 2 of the 3 resupply packs in each respawn just above player height to minimise ammo hogging.

That is all (No architecture was changed)
