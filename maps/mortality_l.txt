     Generic Mortality [League Variant]	
	===========================

Objective: Enter the enemy base and make
your way to the flag room.
Return the flag to your base on the raised
platform in the lobby to capture it. 

Scoring: 10 team points per Capture
         5 personal points per Capture

Notes: Flag carriers drop the flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their base
after 60 seconds.

That's not an invisible wall there's a fan 
at the end of the corridor. 

This map was designed for advanced (i.e. 
weapon-assisted-jumping e.t.c) players.
